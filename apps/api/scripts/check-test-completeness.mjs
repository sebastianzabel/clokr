/**
 * D-09 (Phase 106): hard floor on collected test files and tests.
 *
 * Parallelisation can silently collect fewer files than intended. Every collected test would still
 * pass, coverage would dip only slightly, and the 40% line threshold could still be cleared — so
 * R6 ("no .skip, no weakened assertion") would be violated in effect while CI stayed green. This
 * script turns that class of silent failure into a red build.
 *
 * The price, accepted deliberately in D-09: these two numbers must be raised when tests are added.
 * The failure message says exactly that, and exactly how.
 *
 * NOTE: the JSON reporter's own `numTotalTestSuites` field counts `describe` blocks across all
 * files, NOT files (see 106-MEASUREMENTS.md § "Suite size (D-09 floor inputs)" — a 197-file suite
 * reported numTotalTestSuites=800). The true file count is `testResults.length`, which matches
 * vitest's own terminal "Test Files N passed (N)" summary exactly. Do NOT read numTotalTestSuites
 * for MIN_FILES.

// Re-measured 2026-09-16 on the merged tree (`pnpm --filter @clokr/api test`, one clean full run,
// read from apps/api/vitest-report.json: testResults.length for files, numTotalTests for tests —
// 249 files, 2836 tests, 0 failed, 3 skipped). The prior floor (241/2780, Phase 204's own branch
// before this merge) undercounted the merged tree by 8 files: Phase 113b's characterization
// baseline (PR #221, 5 new files: context-area-map, measure-context-coverage,
// measure-saldo-path-parity, leave-characterization, shifts-characterization) and PR #227's three
// tenant-scoping security tests (sec-10/11/12, fixing #223/#224/#225) both landed on main after
// Phase 204's branch was cut, and this merge brings both in for the first time alongside Phase
// 204's own test files (this gate's own suite plus its fixtures).
