/**
 * D-09 (Phase 106): hard floor on collected test files and tests.
 *
 * Parallelisation can silently collect fewer files than intended. Every collected test would still
 * pass, coverage would dip only slightly, and the 40% line threshold could still be cleared — so
 * R6 ("no .skip, no weakened assertion") would be violated in effect while CI stayed green. This
 * script turns that class of silent failure into a red build.
 *
 * The price, accepted deliberately in D-09: these two numbers must be raised when tests are added.
 * The failure message says exactly that, and exactly how.
 *
 * NOTE: the JSON reporter's own `numTotalTestSuites` field counts `describe` blocks across all
 * files, NOT files (see 106-MEASUREMENTS.md § "Suite size (D-09 floor inputs)" — a 197-file suite
 * reported numTotalTestSuites=800). The true file count is `testResults.length`, which matches
 * vitest's own terminal "Test Files N passed (N)" summary exactly. Do NOT read numTotalTestSuites
 * for MIN_FILES.
