/**
 * D-09 (Phase 106): hard floor on collected test files and tests.
 *
 * Parallelisation can silently collect fewer files than intended. Every collected test would still
 * pass, coverage would dip only slightly, and the 40% line threshold could still be cleared — so
 * R6 ("no .skip, no weakened assertion") would be violated in effect while CI stayed green. This
 * script turns that class of silent failure into a red build.
 *
 * The price, accepted deliberately in D-09: these two numbers must be raised when tests are added.
 * The failure message says exactly that, and exactly how.
 *
 * NOTE: the JSON reporter's own `numTotalTestSuites` field counts `describe` blocks across all
 * files, NOT files (see 106-MEASUREMENTS.md § "Suite size (D-09 floor inputs)" — a 197-file suite
 * reported numTotalTestSuites=800). The true file count is `testResults.length`, which matches
 * vitest's own terminal "Test Files N passed (N)" summary exactly. Do NOT read numTotalTestSuites
 * for MIN_FILES.

// clean full run of `pnpm --filter @clokr/api test`, read from apps/api/vitest-report.json —
// testResults.length for files, numTotalTests for tests — 249 files, 2839 tests, 0 failed, 3
// skipped. MIN_FILES is UNCHANGED at 249: plan 99B-01's #229 null-guard tests (one in
// lint-tenant-scoping-candidates.test.ts, two in lint-tenant-scoping.test.ts) were added to
// EXISTING test files so the file count could not move (D-23 requires this — a guard with no test
// would rest its correctness on a one-off manual demonstration). MIN_TESTS rises from 2836 to 2839,
// exactly the 3 new test cases those guards added. Every wave 2-8 move-plan in phase 99b asserts
// equality against THIS number, not the pre-phase 2836.
